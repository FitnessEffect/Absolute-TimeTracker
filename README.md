# Absolute-TimeTracker
The TimeTracker application allows employees of Absolute Mobile Solutions to record their work time entries using their iPhones. The application will also retrieve
and display the entries for the current week. Users have the possibility to select a different date and edit or delete any entries.
On screen rotation, the entries for the week selected will display in the form of a graph.

Absolute-TimeTracker requires charts framework to be installed. In order to do so:
clone project > cd into project folder > run $ pod install (from command line)
